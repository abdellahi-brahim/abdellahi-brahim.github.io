Snakes and Ladders Game
=======================
This project is a simple simulation of the popular board game "Snakes and Ladders" using Python and the Pygame library.

Getting Started
---------------
To run the game, you will need to install Python 3 and Pygame. You can do this using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command:

`pip install pygame`

Once you have installed Pygame, you can run the simulation locally by running the `main.py` script under the `simulation` directory:

`python simulation/main.py`

The Game
----------------

The game is played with 4 players. Each player takes turns rolling two dice and moving their piece accordingly. If a player lands on a square with the base of a ladder, they climb the ladder to the corresponding square at the top. If a player lands on a square with the head of a snake, they slide down the snake to the corresponding square at the bottom.

The first player to reach the last square wins.
